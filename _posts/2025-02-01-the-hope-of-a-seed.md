There is nothing more miraculous than a seed. All the potential of creation is packed into a seemingly inert grain of sand. Miracles all around us, sometimes we just don't see it. Over the last couple of weeks, my husband James has been planting pepper and eggplant seeds. Today is tomatoes. Even though we know from years past that these seeds that we so carefully saved in previous seasons will germinate and grow into a lovely plant that will give us many pounds of produce, it is hard to envision the future of this tiny seed as being anything significant at all.

## Saving Seeds: A Gateway to Miracles

Saving seed is a great way to participate in this miracle and to save money as well! Be sure to save seed from open pollinated and not hybrid varieties, as the hybrid varieties will not come true. If you have access to children (or fun-loving adults) they will enjoy sharing this experience. 

## Our Seed Starting Process

We start by filling seed trays with good quality, lightweight seeding mix. Berger is a good potting mix that we have used and it is very affordable. We firm the soil into the trays and then poke 3-4 holes per square where we insert 1 or 2 seeds. Germination rates will vary depending on seed type and variety, so better to have too many seeds come up than too few. You can always clip a few seedlings from the cluster with a pair of scissors if you have too many seedlings per square. I would keep at least 2 per square though. 

After the tray is full, water in with a GENTLE sprinkle of water. I like to use fish emulsion and seaweed in the water to give the seedlings a good boost. Be sure to mark which type and variety so you can save seed in the future.

## Providing the Right Conditions

Some seedlings, like peppers and eggplants, will benefit from a little bottom heat. There are special heating pads for this purpose. Or you can just put them in a protected spot where they will stay warm in the winter months. (We use shade cloth to keep seedlings cooler for late summer plantings.) The picture below shows a simple cloche frame with prayer candles looking on in reverence to the miracle.
