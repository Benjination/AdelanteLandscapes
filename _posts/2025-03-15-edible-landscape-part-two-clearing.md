So, here we go! Plan in hand; I am filled with enthusiasm to implement my edible landscape design. Where to begin? As you can see from my last post, there are some issues that need to be dealt with from the beginning. Firstly, there is all that lawn to be removed! Sod is so easy to install, and so difficult to remove once it is established. Secondly, we have inherited two dead post oak trees in our new landscape that will need to be removed. If we wait to remove the trees until after we plant, the branches could fall on tender plants and crush them.

## Phased Clearing Approach

The clearing will need to be done in stages to accommodate future phases. For example, we will leave the area where the fire pit goes for now. (This is one of the reasons it is so helpful to work from a plan.) While clearing is not really the fun part of implementing your landscape design, it is a crucial step and must be done correctly. 

## The Problem with Shortcuts

One of the most common problems I see in my profession is poor bed preparation. There is really nothing more irksome to me than seeing Bermuda grass entangled in shrub beds. Often, trying to skip the back breaking work of bed clearing, gardeners will put down "weed barrier" or (ugh) plastic in their beds to try to smother out the existing grass, just covering the material with mulch. 

**This does not work**, and ends up creating a real mess of weed fabric/plastic, grass and plantings. The only solution to this scenario is to pull out the planting and start over on bed clearing. 

*Note: Solarization is a bed clearing method that does utilize plastic. Thick black plastic is used to cover grass before planting that uses heat to kill existing vegetation. This method may work for you, especially if you apply a 20% vinegar beforehand. Just don't plant until all grass has been removed!*

## Our Proven Method

The method we use for our bed clearing, and the one I have found to be most effective, is good old-fashioned shovel work. I would love to be able to tell you that I dug the grass from my beds myself, but I had someone else do it for me. This is truly back-breaking work! 

## Soil Preparation is Key

The soil on our property has a lot of clay, and compost is the best product to loosen that clay. I know it will take multiple applications to build the soil over time, but it is so very important. **Please invest in your bed preparation. Truly, this is the most crucial step in a successful garden.**

## Tree Removal Adventures

I would also love to tell you that I did the right thing and hired professionals to remove the trees. This is not the case. My son Joe took on the challenge with ropes and tackle in a feat of daring-do, he took down the trees over a period of about 4 days. I was glad to be out of town visiting my new grandson Ziggy so I did not have to watch this dangerous job being done. Luckily everything went well! 

On to more fun in the gardenâ€¦
