The garden is a thing of beauty to behold…except when it isn't. With temperatures falling into the twenties and even into the teens for a couple of weeks this last month, all I could do was stare out the window (when I dared to look), and watch as the water in the cells of my lush greens turn into icicles. Last weekend, when I did finally venture out to review the damage, the smell of rotting vegetation was palpable. I set to work with my pruners to see what could be salvaged.

## Learning from Each Season

With each new variety we plant, we learn a little more about which will do better in extreme weather. Some things did fair a little better than others and the edible garden is nothing if not experimental. 

## The Champions

The **'Seascape' strawberries** and **'Red Russian' kale** were troopers. The strawberry leaves even turned a beautiful red. I will definitely plant more of these beauties, as they take the summer heat as well. The **carrots and cilantro** bounced back just fine, as if to say "bring it on winter!"

## Quick Recovery

The tender new shoots of asparagus were desiccated, but we just cut them back to the ground and they will be fine.

## The Circle of Life

All in all, the garden is looking much better. As for the wilted and sad looking vegetation I removed…great chicken forage! The circle of life is working its magic in North Central Texas and we are gathering our seeds for spring seedlings.

*Winter teaches us resilience - both in our gardens and in ourselves. Every season brings lessons that make us better gardeners.*
