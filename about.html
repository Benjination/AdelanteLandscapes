            <h2>Passionate Designer, Skilled Educator</h2>
            <p class="lead">For over three decades, I have been designing and installing landscapes that celebrate the natural beauty of Texas while creating functional, sustainable outdoor spaces for families to enjoy.</p>
            
            <p>My journey in landscape design began with a deep love for plants and a desire to help others connect with nature through their outdoor spaces. What started as a passion has evolved into a comprehensive practice that emphasizes sustainable design principles, native plant communities, and edible landscaping.</p>
            
            <p>Through Adelante Landscapes, I focus on creating gardens that are not just beautiful, but also environmentally responsible, water-wise, and productive. Every project is an opportunity to demonstrate how thoughtful design can enhance both our lives and our local ecosystems.</p>

          <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
          <blockquote>
            "I believe that every landscape should tell a story - the story of the people who live there, the story of the place, and the story of how we can live in harmony with the natural world."
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>My approach to landscape design is rooted in the belief that outdoor spaces should be:</p>
          
          <ul class="philosophy-list">
            <li><strong>Sustainable:</strong> Working with natural systems and local climate to create landscapes that thrive with minimal inputs</li>
            <li><strong>Functional:</strong> Meeting the real needs of families while creating spaces for relaxation, entertainment, and connection</li>
            <li><strong>Beautiful:</strong> Celebrating the inherent beauty of Texas landscapes while expressing each client's personal style</li>
            <li><strong>Educational:</strong> Demonstrating how thoughtful design can benefit both people and environment</li>
            <li><strong>Evolving:</strong> Creating dynamic landscapes that change and improve over time, reflecting the natural cycles of growth and renewal</li>
