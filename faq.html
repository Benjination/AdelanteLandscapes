      <h3>How much does landscape design cost in North Texas?</h3>
      <p>Our landscape design consultations start at $100 and provide comprehensive recommendations for your property. Full design projects typically range from $2,000-$15,000+ depending on size and complexity. We serve Dallas, Fort Worth, Plano, and surrounding areas.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What plants work best in North Texas clay soil?</h3>
      <p>Native Texas plants like Texas Red Oak, Flame Leaf Sumac, and native grasses thrive in our clay soil. For edible gardens, we recommend raised beds with amended soil for vegetables, while fruit trees like pomegranates and figs adapt well to clay.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>When is the best time to plant in the Dallas area?</h3>
      <p>Spring (March-May) and fall (September-November) are ideal for most planting in North Texas. Summer heat is too stressful for new plants, while winter limits root development. Our timing guides are specific to DFW weather patterns.</p>
