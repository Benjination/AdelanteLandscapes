## 🛠️ **Behind the Scenes**

### **What Changed from Manual System**

**Before:**
- Had to manually add each post to blog.html
- Static categories that didn't reflect actual content  
- Hard-coded post links that could break
- No filtering or search functionality

**Now:**
- Jekyll automatically processes all posts in `_posts`
- Dynamic categories based on actual post categories
- Automatic URL generation for all posts
- Working category filtering with JavaScript
- Rich post templates with navigation and related posts

### **Key Files**

- **`blog.html`** - Main blog index page (now fully dynamic)
- **`_layouts/post.html`** - Template for individual blog posts
- **`_posts/*.md`** - Your blog post content files
- **`BLOG_POST_TEMPLATE.md`** - Template for creating new posts

### **How It Works**

1. **Jekyll processes** all files in `_posts` directory
2. **Blog page automatically** lists all posts using `site.posts`
3. **Categories dynamically** display using `site.categories`
4. **JavaScript filtering** allows visitors to filter by category
5. **Individual post pages** use the `post.html` layout template
