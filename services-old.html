          <h2>Edible Landscaping</h2>
          <p>Edible landscaping has seen a resurgence in popularity over the last decades, offering a healthy and rewarding pastime for many gardeners. Adelante Landscape specializes in edible landscape design for the entire site, incorporating edible plantings throughout the landscape.</p>
          
          <p>Our designs are unique and specific to your site and palette. In addition to the obvious benefits of lower grocery bills and personal connection to your food source, edible plants are unique and beautiful design elements for your garden.</p>

          <h2>Sustainable Design</h2>
          <p>Adelante Landscape has a strong commitment to sustainable design practices in all phases of site development. In the initial consultation between the designer and client, an inventory of the existing conditions and on-site materials will be taken.</p>
          
          <p>The focus of the design development is to minimize input, as well as reducing output for the site. This design program utilizes existing assets as much as possible, building soils with organic practices, harvesting water for reuse, and designing with edible and perennial plants.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Water harvesting and conservation</li>
            <li>Organic soil building practices</li>
            <li>Native and adapted plant selection</li>
            <li>Existing asset utilization</li>
            <li>Environmentally sensitive design</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Organic planting and maintenance practices are the final steps in producing a holistic, self-contained environment -- a healthful, beautiful landscape to feed the body, mind and spirit.</p>

          <h2>Perennial Landscapes</h2>
          <p>In addition to our edible landscape program, Adelante specializes in perennial landscape design, many times blending the two to produce a delightful tapestry of color, smell and taste.</p>
          
          <p>In the styles of the French and English Cottage Gardens, our designs combine fruit trees, swales of annual vegetables and perennial color with antique roses to produce a year-round display of color and interest.</p>
          
          <p>Sturdy and steadfast, perennial plants are like good friends that return for a delightful, yearly visit. Whether casually strewn along a meandering woodland pathway or sprawling over tidy borders, these old friends are always welcome.</p>
