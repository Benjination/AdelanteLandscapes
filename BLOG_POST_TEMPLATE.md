## Fall is the Secret Season for Texas Vegetable Gardening

While many gardeners think the growing season ends in summer, experienced Texas gardeners know that fall offers some of the best conditions for growing vegetables. With cooler temperatures and (hopefully) more reliable rainfall, fall gardens often outperform their spring counterparts.

## Best Vegetables for Texas Fall Gardens

### Quick-Growing Crops (Ready in 4-6 weeks)
- **Lettuce** - Plant varieties like Black Seeded Simpson and Buttercrunch
- **Spinach** - Bloomsdale and Space are heat-tolerant varieties
- **Radishes** - Cherry Belle and Easter Egg varieties thrive in fall
- **Arugula** - Adds peppery flavor to salads

### Medium-Season Crops (Ready in 6-10 weeks)
- **Swiss Chard** - Fordhook Giant produces all season long
- **Kale** - Winterbor and Red Russian handle Texas winters
- **Turnips** - Both roots and greens are edible
- **Asian Greens** - Bok choy and mizuna love cool weather

### Long-Season Crops (Ready in 10-14 weeks)
- **Broccoli** - Plant transplants in early September
- **Cauliflower** - Needs consistent moisture for best heads
- **Cabbage** - Early Jersey Wakefield is reliable
- **Brussels Sprouts** - Plant now for winter harvest

## Planting Timeline for North Texas

- **Early August**: Start seeds indoors for broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage
- **Late August**: Direct sow lettuce, spinach, radishes
- **Early September**: Transplant brassicas, sow turnips and Asian greens
- **Late September**: Final planting of quick crops like lettuce

## Success Tips from 30 Years of Fall Gardening

1. **Improve your soil first** - Add compost and organic matter before planting
2. **Plan for water** - Fall rains aren't guaranteed; have irrigation ready
3. **Use row covers** - Protect tender crops from unexpected early freezes
4. **Succession plant** - Sow lettuce every 2 weeks for continuous harvest
5. **Watch the weather** - Be ready to protect plants when temperatures drop

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Planting too late (vegetables need time to mature before hard freeze)
- Overcrowding plants (good air circulation prevents disease)
- Neglecting water during dry spells
- Not protecting plants from cabbage worms and aphids

## Ready to Start Your Fall Garden?

Fall vegetable gardening extends your growing season and provides fresh produce when grocery store vegetables are at their most expensive. Start planning your fall garden now for the best selection and timing.
